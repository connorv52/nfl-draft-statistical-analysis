#  NFL Draft Statistical Analysis (2000-2021)
This project aims to analyze NFL Draft and NFL Combine data from 2000 to 2021 within Jupyter Notebooks. Python and its analysis-oriented libraries (Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas) will be used throughout the notebook in addition to commentary and written analysis on the relevant cells.   

As the National Football League (NFL) has expanded in size and popularity, so has the NFL draft in pursuing the next generation of star players. With the league's ever-changing rulebook and the game becoming more dynamic, every team is seeking to gain a competitive advantage in assembling their 52-man rosters. Hence, team owners and general managers commonly look at the yearly NFL draft to address their team's weak points and add a dash of young, raw, and driven talent to their rosters. That being said, not all NFL positions are created equally, and recent trends observed in the sport over the last few decades have subsequently compelled teams to reconsider how they build their rosters from the ground upâ€”starting with the draft. Additionally, with an [abundance of literature and research](https://trace.tennessee.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1333&context=jasm) indicating the significance of a team's draft to its future success, it is more important now than ever for all NFL franchises to dedicate a substantial portion of their offseason to scouting and scrutinizing the next cohort of athletes (Reynolds et al., 2015).

In this project, we will consider and potentially provide answers to questions such as:

- **Are certain positions more coveted in the draft than others?**
- **What does the average draft look like over the years?**
- **Do height, weight, and other attributes significantly help players' draft stock?**
- **How important are the colleges that players attended in determining their selection?**
- **Do successful and non-successful NFL teams behave differently in their approach to the draft?**
